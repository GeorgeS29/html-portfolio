<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hey my name is George. I am learning how to do web developing at the moment, but am not stopping there.
  I plan on expanding my knowledge past Web developing and into AI and other fields in computer science.
  As a novice who has just started (it is 2023) it has been nothing but good fun so far. I am not at
  the point where I am staring at a computer screen looking for a mispalced comma yet.</p>

<p>I hope to expand my knowledge not only by myself but with the great computer science community
  throughout the world. To put this about me page simple and short I am here to expand my knowledge,
  and add value to computer science any way I can. Thank you guys, feel free to reach out to my email
  to chat!</p>
